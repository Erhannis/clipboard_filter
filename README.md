# clipboard_filter

Push a button, run your clipboard through a regex replace.
An application.
Comes default with a "remove params from urls" and a "reduce Amazon link to simple" replacement.
Thanks to [cli_script](https://pub.dev/packages/cli_script) for writing the regex replacement code, which frankly ought to have been built into Dart to begin with.
